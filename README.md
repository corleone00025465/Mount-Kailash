How to Run the Website
The website is a pure static HTML file (no backend dependencies), with the core file named Mount Kailash.html. You can run it in the following ways:
Method 1: Open Directly in Browser (Simplest)
Locate the Mount Kailash.html file in the project directory;
Double-click the file, or right-click and select "Open with Browser" (Chrome, Firefox, or other modern browsers are recommended).
Method 2: Run via Local Static Server (Recommended, Avoid Path Issues)
If the page includes relative-path resources (e.g., images, fonts), use a local server for better compatibility:
Prerequisite：Install Python 3 or Node.js (choose one).
Option A: Python Built-in Server
Open Terminal, navigate to the project directory (e.g., cd ~/Desktop/HTML);
Run the command: python3 -m http.server 8000;
Visit in browser: http://localhost:8000/Mount%20Kailash.html.
Option B: Node.js http-server
Install the tool globally (first-time use): npm install -g http-server;
Navigate to the project directory in Terminal, run: http-server -p 8000;
Visit in browser: http://localhost:8000/Mount%20Kailash.html.
